## Key features:

<br>

### 1. Simplified transfer

We will automatically detect if your transfer is suspicious by looking at your past transfers. 
Using our complex algorithm, we determine your average transfer amount and if it
the current transfer amount is less than that then we automatically let you transfer! 

However, if the amount is more than the average, we will automatically ask you for you password.
So no need to worry!

<br>

### 2. Location Tracking

We detect where the location of your transfer happens and automatically reject transfers when the current location is too far from previous known locations! 

We determine this by looking at your longitude and lattitutde and we reject any transfers made 2 degrees apart from your previous location.

<br>

### 3. Credit Cards (Coming soon!)

We automatically create a profile of your credit card expenditures and we will then perform Machine Learning and AI to observe your spending habits and if any purchase is out of the ordinary, we will immediately flag it and have a customer service representative contact you!

Isn't that amazing?
